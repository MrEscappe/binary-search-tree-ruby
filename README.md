# Binary Search Tree in Ruby

Part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)


------------

### Assignment

Youâ€™ll build a balanced BST in this assignment. Do not use duplicate values because they make it more complicated and result in trees that are much harder to balance. Therefore, be sure to always remove duplicate values or check for an existing value before inserting.

------------

### Testing

- Create a binary search tree from an array of random numbers (**Array.new(15) { rand(1..100) }**)
- Confirm that the tree is balanced by calling #balanced?
- Print out all elements in level, pre, post, and in order
- Unbalance the tree by adding several numbers > 100
- Confirm that the tree is unbalanced by calling #balanced?
- Balance the tree by calling #rebalance
- Confirm that the tree is balanced by calling #balanced?
- Print out all elements in level, pre, post, and in order

Another one quite challenging, took some time to understand but I figure out in the end.

Thanks for stackoverflow :fa-smile-o:
